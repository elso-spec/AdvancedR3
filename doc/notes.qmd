SESSION 1: build dependencies - written in the script (Imports in the
DESCRIPTION FILE) workflow dependencies - entirely in console (suggests
in the DESCRIPTION FILE)

if you want to change the Rprofile script: \> edit_r_profile()

For tidyverse and tidymodels, add to depends instead, since this is a
meta-package: \> use_package("tidyverse", "depends")
